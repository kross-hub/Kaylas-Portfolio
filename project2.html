  <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
  <p>After an in-depth analysis of its three main competitors Oh Ranger Park Finder, Recreation.gov, and Reserve America. The facts show that the three competitors have many of the same strengths with little variations which allow them to stand apart from one another. Oh, Ranger Park Finder focuses on sites in National Parks and Public Land.  Recreation.gov broadens its horizons while committing to being a door to sites as well as activities. Lastly, Reserve America sets itself apart by being one of the first sites to all online reservations. It is evident that the opportunities for a new company are prevalent after a deep review of its competitors. First, it is vital that the new site will be very well organized and allow users to personalize their pages to share with the public space. Furthermore, it is important that collaboration is extended in new and creative ways such as reviews and experiences at specific sites. In addition, there is an opportunity to create a more modern site with more features and search filters. The future company should target one of these niche audiences in order to reach and help a greater depth of specified users.

     <h3>Generally</h3>
      <p>It is important that a new app breaking into the camping app market maintains the strengths found in its competitors without carrying over their weaknesses.In addition allowing for more search filters and planning features is key to meeting our users needs.  </p>
     <h3>User Survey</h3>
     <p>It is important that a new site breaking into the camping app market maintains the strengths found in its competitors without carrying over their weaknesses. There is room for a new competitor in the market if the said competitor is able to give enough value within their product to drive use.  Targeting a new niche market for those who enjoy dispersed camping and have a need for an app to make the planning process easier for them will drive traffic to a new app on the market.</p>

Furthermore, alterations to the “how to use the site” were found to be necessary.</p>

  <section class="container4">
      <section class="border">
        <h5>Pain Point 1</h5>
        <p>When asked to view completed and recently viewed sites users were confused on where to tap in order to look at the diffrent screens. Users expressed that they couldnt tell which screen they were currently on as which led them to confusion on how to get to another screen. </p>

  <section class="container4">
      <section class="border">
        <h5>Pain Point 4</h5>
        <p>When asked to navigate to view your history and completed sites users expressed confusion on how the completed sites appeared here. I was given feedback such as “how do you know they actually did a trip at this site and didn't just leave a review?” and “how do you know they didn't show up and it was raining and then they left?”. </p>
        <img class="Painpoint-4" src="Images/changes_eightmobile.png" alt="Pain-4">
      </section>
      <section class= "border">
        <h5>Solution 4</h5>
        <p>In my next iteration of the history tab, I changed my verbiage located on my tabs to eliminate users’ confusion. By changing the completed tab to a reviewed tab users were no longer confused about how the sites appeared on this tab due to having reviewed this site during the prototype process. I also found this to better satisfy the portion of my MVP stating “As a returning user I would like to be able to see others reviews and my own reviews to make more informed decisions when choosing a camping site”.</p>
        <img class="Solution-4" src="Images/changes_tenmobile.png" alt="Solution4">
      </section>
          <section class="border">
            <h5>Pain Point 5</h5>
            <p>When asked to navigate further through the app in order to view favorite sites as well as create a packing list for the users camping trip all users tested expressed many pain points during this step. The first being confused when they had saved a site. Again I was reminded of the value of verbiage. In order to fix this confusion, I changed the tab to “Favorites Sites” because that is what the users had done when selecting the heart to have these sites be added to this page. Furthermore, users had confusion on how to add a packing list and the original toggling between tabs in order to add a list.</p>
            <img class="Painpoint5mobile" src="Images/onboardinghowtoone.png" alt="Changes-Four">
          </section>
          <section class= "border">
            <h5>Solution 5</h5>
            <p> To make this process more intuitive a “add” icon was placed on the packing list tab making navigating to create a packing list easy to locate. I found that users were successful in adding a list of 100% of the time after making this change.Furthermore, this change helped to satisfy the user story as a returning user, I want to be able to see my save information in order to keep track of future and past trips.</p>

          <section class="border">
            <h5>Pain Point 6</h5>
            <p>Finally, when asked to add information to create a packing list there was an abundance of confusion from multiple users on how to navigate through this process. Users addressed concerns on how to add a name and description for their list. Furthermore, users were unsure of the correct way to add items to their list. However, users did not express confusion on how they would share this information with others. </p>

          <h5>Solution 6</h5>
          <p>  In order to satisfy the confusion during this process, new features were added after referring to IOS interface guidelines. Such as a data entry field that is more familiar and intuitive to users for both adding a name and description as well as adding items. After creating these changes 97.8% of users expressed little to no confusion during this process. </p>

  <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
  <section class="container2">
    <p class="margintopvisual">We present TentDays, a website that seamlessly allows users to plan their camping trips with minimal effort to cater to our users’ needs. TentDays allows users to search for the perfect dispersed camping location while being able to see other reviews and experiences to guide them. In addition, TentDays allows for easy planning and packing with the suggested packing list and activity suggestions.  This allows users to share and collaborate on a public or private forum with friends, family, and like-minded people. Lastly, the platform supports easy and intuitive use and collaboration which ultimately will encourage outdoor enthusiasts to start utilizing the tool available to them.

<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
    <section class="container2">
    <p class="margintopvisual">It was a rewarding experience to design a product from scratch. Though the direction wasn’t clear in the beginning, each step added clarity and helped me to get closer to the final prototype. While there are still a lot of possibilities to explore when creating a dispersed camping app to benefit users this is a good start. I learned that your assumptions about users are not always true and it is important to do large amounts of well thought out research in order to confirm or prove beliefs in order to create a beneficial product for our users. A few insights during the usability tests were particularly surprising to me. Some of the elements which I thought were intuitive were found to be pain points. However, eventually, the testing and feedback allowed me to design an even better solution catered to the user’s pain points. I learned that research and testing are vital to completing any project. Furthermore, it became obvious to me that it is important to focus on the needs of the MVP before adding any other features. If I had more time, I would have considered doing more research at different steps in the process.</p>
